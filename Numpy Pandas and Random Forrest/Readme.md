# Numpy, Pandas and Random Forrest

* Numpy and pandas are both libraries for number crunching
* Pandas is built on top of numpy
* Pandas is better in handling tabular data
* While numpy is good at smaller tasks like mean, median, etc

**Numpy arrays are homogenous unlike python lists.** In python lists you could have one element as a string, one an integer, and another a decimal value. However, numpy arrays have same data types for each element.

This contains two different md files which both contain pandas and numpy code.
